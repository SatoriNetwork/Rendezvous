# this should probably be moved to the node

# listen we have a connection to the Rendezvous server
# we also have many streams which represent a topic
# we need to make many connections per topic
#
# todo: modularize this
# also remove the hard coded functionality and make a new layer that manages the
# topic synchronization. we have a design now that stays connected to the server
# and only asks for our peers per topic once. No. we should ask for our peers
# a few times a day. and just send in all our topics each time. but that should
# be handled by a layer above this. we have to plan it out.
